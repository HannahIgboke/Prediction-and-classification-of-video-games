# Project Overview
The online gaming industry experiences unpredictable changes in sales and performance metrics due to the continuous advent and improvement of video games. This project takes a deep dive into historical data on video game sales to:

- Understand what the gaming industry market in the last three decades has been like
- Identify key features influencing the performance of these games globally and regionally.
- Predict global sales based on relevant properties
- Provide a solution to the question: what game feature combinations will turn in high or low sales?

The project workflow below seeks to address these pain points.

# Workflow
